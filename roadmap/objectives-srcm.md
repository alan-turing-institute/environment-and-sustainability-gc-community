# RCM Objectives for Turing E&S GC (2024)

Developed as part of the Turing annual objective setting exercise. These objectives form a direction of travel - it is not exepcted that all are completed in the reivew period (we are not in complete control of all factors!), but we will work to evidence progress in these directions.


## Objective 1: Community strategy
### Category: Reinforcing the role of the Institute as a national body in the UK and International landscape
### Target date: 28th June
### Activity
- Use systematic stakeholder mapping to record/identify stakeholders in the E&S GC across all sectors, and classify them according to engagement and community readiness.
- Create visual map representations of the community for analysis and communication.
- Develop strategy for growth in targetted areas.
- Engage with both national and international stakeholders.
- Ensure the strategy is aligned with internal and project activities.

### Value
An effective community strategy will enable the design and delivery of impactful activities associated with the E&S GC, which are well-grounded in the needs of the community.

Such a strategy will enable the GC programme to connect with the right people at the right time, and collaborate with them in line with best practice for open, inclusive and reproducible research. This meaningful engagement will add to the sustainability of the GC and community activities through increased stakeholder buy-in and equitable participation. 

### Targets
#### Stakeholder map
- Awareness of the data collection implications for privacy. Undertake analysis, prepare DPAP, develop processes for data management.
> [name=Alejandro ©]: what does DPAP mean?
DPAP- Data collection and wrangling tools (databases, code, documentation).
- Visual representation and communication of the stakeholder data into a community maps - internal and external.
- Analysis of the community data to identify objective measures which could be used in assessments of community health and growth. 
- Report and communicate processes and tools developed for stakeholder mapping activities.
#### Strategy
- Develop aims and success outcomes for community engagement over the next funding period. What are we trying to achieve and why? 
- Alignment of E&S community strategy with RCM, TPS and Turing 2.0 strategy.
- Develop a roadmap for delivery of the strategy.
- Engage with Turing Business teams in development and delivery.


## Objective 2: Community resources
### Category: Embedding EDI
### Target date: Open ended
### Activity
- Develop and share E&S community documentation and activities to develop plans for embedding open science and reproducibility in E&S.
- Develop EDS Book as a key publishing tool and community asset.

### Value
High quality community documentation will support community members to meaningfully engage with the E&S GC, and encourage sustained participation through positive and equitable expereinces. Documentation will include processes and scaffolding for achieving best practice in open and collaborative research, leading to more impactful and sustainable research and capacity building.

### Targets
- Development and maintainace of open source community project pages (github repository).
- Documentation of processes and planning around community activity or resources development, for transparency and reporducibility. 
- Creating and participating in engagement activities.


## Objective 3: Community engagement in Y2 mission development
### Category:  Development, delivery and support of the Turing 2.0 strategic priorities
### Target date: Open ended
### Activity
- Leading the community engagement and implementation plan to develop E&S missions and roadmap for the next funding period (Y2).

### Value
A community-informed mission will enable the identification of areas of strength and ambition for research, and potential for coordinated impact.

### Targets
- Recording progress towards roadmap.
- Consultation on existing roadmap.
- Mission scoping activities.
- Desk research of ways to enable community involvement.


## Objective 4: Advocacy
### Category: Reinforcing the role of the Institute as a national body in the UK and International landscape
### Target date: Open ended
### Activity
- Represent and communicate Turing’s E&S and community initiatives on professional (national and international) platforms, connecting communities from the broader data science ecosystem.
- Initiatives include: Turing, TPS, E&S, RCMs, EDS Book.

### Value
Successful advocacy of our activities in all sectors will encourage broad and impactful engagement, by attracting stakeholders with aligned values, resourcing and expertise.

### Targets
- Bringing people into our activities through external engagement and outreach activities.
- Writing academic papers on RCM work.
- Giving international talks, panels and training on the topic. 
- Supporting RCM members to deliver activities through training, workshops and advisory roles for other mission-aligned organisations. 
- Internal advocacy and mentoring within and between initiatives; participation and representation in meetings.
- Leverageing initiatives and research projects to engage in advocacy.


## Objective 5: Internal ways of working
### Category: Building a culture of “Team Turing” and demonstration of our stated values
### Target date: e.o. May 2024
### Activity
- Aligning and operationalising ways of working to support engagement make involvement of different core capabilities, research teams and business teams within the GC.
- Include RACI matricies where approriate.

### Value
Clear and agreed upon ways of working will support the team to engage with eachother efficiently and effectively. Documenting will add sustainability and reproducibility to the programme.

### Targets
- Progress towards agreeing on ways of working within the community.
- Progress towards establishing ways of working with other core capabilities.
- Contribution to [E&S Operations handbook](https://thealanturininstitute.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/ESGrandChallenge245/ERjIykJ19h9JtAH0hqAmH3wBIojXybjrxLMGybs8EQqPbw?e=HTfAPA)

## Objective 6: RCM Best practice
### Category: Embedding EDI
### Target date: Open ended
### Activity
- Contribute to Developing and standardising Research Community Management (RCM) team processes and documentation to guide team members with workflows and frameworks aligned with the institute's culture and values, including our commitments to Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI).

### Value
This will conribute to delivering towards building a culture of “Team Turing” and demonstration of our stated team guiding principles.

### Targets
- Process documentation from stakeholder mapping work.
- Contribution to the templates in the RCM documentation from E&S community infrastructure work.
- Archiving process documentation from previous objectives for general use in RCM team.


## Objective 7: TPS Best practice
### Category: Reinforcing the role of the Institute as a national body in the UK and International landscape
### Target date: Open ended
### Activity
- Engage Turing researchers, specifically from E&S and TPS in The Turing Way, facilitating bidirectional knowledge sharing through existing approaches discussed in other objectives.
- Work with the community to share their processes more openly, e.g. via EDS Book.

### Value
This will contribute to the efficacy and equitabilility of practice used within our community, and support them in the development and sharing of best practices. 

### Targets
- Sharing best practices from E&S in The Turing Way.
- Supporting E&S team members in capturing examples and case studies relating to best practice in TTW and EDS Book.
- Engaging with collaborators and community in The Turing Way, bringing in new voices from E&S (such as through speaking and training opportunities).
- Bring practices from the Turing Way to enhance ways of working in E&S strengthening open, reproducible and collaborative practices.
