# Operational Structure

The structure mentioned below reflects the interim setup ahead of a formalised governance structure for all grand challenge areas being approved. 

## Research / Development
The interim director is responsible for leadership of the GC with workstream leads being responsible for their own workstreams as well as supporting the leadership of the GC. 

## Operations
Turing business teams from across the various directorates support the on-going needs of the E&SGC. Efforts are predominately coordinated via the programme management team who provide dedicated oversight, support and direction to ensure alignment across operational delivery aspects. This includes but is not limited to; project planning, risk management, contract administration, budget coordination and overall programme delivery and alignment initiatives.

The operational structure is a matrix-based approach that encompasses various teams working in an integrated fashion. Noting, appointed PDRAâ€™s will, in most circumstances, directly report to the corresponding workstream leads. For other roles, Direct line reporting is not superseded by the E&SGC operational structure as various team members need to report back to core departments/functions/line managers within the Turing Institute. Nonetheless, all members are required to support the delivery of the core E&SGC based on the agreed responsibilities and deliverables.
